## Project Description
The sortable drag app allows users to easily rearrange a list of favorite sports by dragging and dropping items. It enhances user experience by providing a simple and interactive way to manage the order of items in a list.

In the future
1. Integrate the sortable list into a larger application, such as a task management system or a content management system, to provide a more interactive user experience.
2. Allow users to manage multiple lists, each with its own sortable items.
3. Provide customization options for the list's appearance and behavior, like drag-and-drop animations or locking items in place.
4. Implement functionality to save the list's order between sessions or for sharing.
5. Support nested lists, allowing users to create hierarchies of sortable items.
